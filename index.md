## About
My research focuses on interest groups and committees in German politics, situated within broader debates on global governance and civil society and institutionalisation theory. I examine how organized interests engage with policymaking processes and influence regulatory outcomes, particularly in the areas of supply chains and human rights. By linking domestic political dynamics to international developments, my work contributes to understanding the role of non-state actors in contemporary governance.

I have served for several years as Managing Editor of *Politische Vierteljahresschrift (PVS)*, the leading German political science journal (Q1 in SSCI), and currently serve as an editor for the *Leopoldina – National Academy of Sciences*.
